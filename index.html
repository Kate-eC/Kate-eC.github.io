  My two closest friends are Ally and Natalie. We met in 7th grade at Williamsburg Middle School. Most of the time we get food, play video games, go to the mall, or skateboard when we are together.
  I have a group of crew friends and we identify ourselves as the Elephant Society. We usually chill at someone's house, play smash, or do something active.
  I also have my lifeguard friends, we just chill, listen to music, and play caps a lot.

  <div class="text" id="sports">
  I do crew. It takes up my life... People say it is a cult and crew people are boring and don't have a life. This is because crew takes up the mind, soul, and time of a person. But I do not let that happen!
  I have participated in swim, tennis, horse backriding, dance, gymnastics, cross country, and soccer in my life.
